## 🚀 About Me

Hi there! I'm Sean. I'm not a traditionally educated programmer, rather it has been a keen hobby of mine the last
16 years or so, and I have really taught myself everything I know. I feel confident to change my career from Electrical Enginneering,
whereby I worked with UPS Systems, in a turnkey context. Professionally I have only ever worked in my family business, whereby one pioneership
of UPS technology can be found within the Republic of South Africa. Working with our own designs of UPS Systems, is where I picked up
a keen interest in computer programming and computing systems in general. I have a passion for building things, and like to see my creations 
come to life. 

- 👀 I kinda got into programming, via first learning Python about 15 or so years ago. So I'll always like Python🐍. So I like fields of work which
     generally, go along the scope of 'Pythonic' code. Things like; Fintech, Cyber Security, Data Science, AI and Bot Development. However I still very much 
     doing web development, whereby I like to use TypeScript, within an Angular Workspace. I enjoy, the "immutable" mindset, and I prefer to code in a
     functional paradigm. I do really enjoy learning about the LiSp(s) & languages like Clojure & ClojureScript, however I am better adapated to
     Python, as well working with TypeScript, within an Angular WorkSpace. having said all this, I see it as a useful programming language to 
     get ideas up, and running quickly. I am able to grasp any syntax of any langugae, pretty quickly 
     
- 💻 Currently, I am learning about Blockchain Technology, and trying to wrap my head around the Elliptical Curve Cryptography of
     Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Monero. I also like The-Open-Network (TON), as well as Polkadot & Algorand. I have a keen interest in the
     way social media works, what influences it has, in both a postive and negative context. I enjoy learnig about how there are diffirent ways to stream data,
     hence I've just started learning about Apache Kafka. I also am learning how to use Google's QuantumAI Platform, as Quantum Mechanics is of a great
     personal interest of mine. I believe Quantum Processors will be a reality, and it has a great benefit for the future of the business world. My ultimate
     aim or personal goal of mine, is to run AI libraries on the Seycamore Device, through using the Cirq Library of the Platform, perhaps find a way to build
     an AI Oracle of Blockchains, to better protect individuals, wanting to genuinely and ethically use blockchain technology for their own financial freedom. 
     I have also developed a keen interest in Markovian chains, and using as compuational tool. I also use Beautiful Soup quite a bit. It's a
     rather, powerful and potent library in my opionion.
     
- 💻 
     
- 💞️ I would like to maybe callobrate on Pythonic projects, where Financial Technologies, work hand in hand with Cyber Security. I do enjoy matters to do
      with security, wether it be in a digital paradigm or not. The way crimes are performed in the modern day is something of intruiging interest to me. I 
      like to imagine ways or solutions to mitigate its effect on modern day systems, and to teach individuals about my ideas. I have been told I have a unquie
      talent to teach things to individuals, and to easily refine complicated matters, to indivduals, who are not technically inclined. 
      
- ⚙️ There are a variety of tools I use. For the most part I prefer to run my scripts in Python virtual enviroments, preferably I like to use conda enviroments,
      over that of the Python generic (venv). I find it easier to handle dependencies, and if I want to, I can still use the pip package manager in any case. 
      For stuff I build as web apps, I like to keep things as simple, and as multi-platform as possible, so I'll generally use a mixture of Flask framework, 
      FastAPI and Streamlit. I'm also teaching myself Angular, Node.js and general JavaScript, so I can carry on from where I stopped, from teaching myself ClojureScript.
