## üöÄ About Me

Hello my name is Sean, professionally I work for a company called BigWinUPS (Pty) Ltd. I am actually a co-founder of the business, along with my father, who is the owner and Managing Director. We are a UPS-Turnkey firm and have transcended into solar engineering. I have been working in the industry for 16 years now.

I enjoy my job, have a passion for the professionalism, workmanship and engineering of my professinal work and I get personal satisfaction for making our client's lives a bit more easier. I also have a passion for computer science, where I enjoy the concepts behind quantum computers, artificial intelligence and I am very much intruiged by blockcahin technology & cyber security. I also have an interest in web development. I enjoy the science behind cryptography, but find it rather difficult, still it's very interesting to me!üòÜ 

I am trained as a UPS engineer, where I was an apprentice at an old company called Matla TPM. Matla, manufactured UPS (uniteruptible power supplies) systems, of a local design in Johannesburg, South Africa. 

My skills in programming include Python, Angular and/or TypeScript, however I am more accunstomed to Python, as I find is easier to get ideas up and running, prototyping the feasbility of an idea for it to be furtherly developed with more prominent languages, better adaptable for its purpose. I am currently teaching myself Clojure development and Babashka scripting, where I would like to blend it for cyber security applcations. Having said this, I am able to adapt to any syntax of any programming language rather quickly. 

Currently I am not looking for any employment, however I am open to offers. Instead I am focusing on taking over what my father built for me, and would love to see it become a success! 

I am interested in working on projects which may interest me, as I do enjoy the challenge and the oppurtunities it may present. You are more than welcome to reach out to me via my email at captianbrunton@gmail.com, I am going to set up a Slack account, and will update it to my profile accordingly. Thank you for taking the time to read about me, I hope to hear from anyone with similar interests. I bid thee a good day, live long and prosper, as a Vulcan would say! üññüèª
