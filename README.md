## 🚀 About Me

Hi there! I'm Sean. I'm not a traditionally educated programmer, rather it has been a keen hobby of mine the last
16 years or so, and I have really taught myself everything I know. I feel confident to change my career from Electrical Enginneering,
whereby I worked with UPS Systems, in a turnkey context. Professionally I have only ever worked in my family business, whereby one pioneership
of UPS technology can be found within the Republic of South Africa. Working with our own designs of UPS Systems, is where I picked up
a keen interest in computer programming and computing systems in general. I have a passion for building things, and like to see my creations 
come to life. 

- 👀 I’m interested in mainly Python Programming, within the context of Fintech, Cyber Security, Data Science, AI and Bot Development.
     I prefer to code in a functional paradigm, as I enjoy, the "immutable" mindset. I do really enjoy learning about the 
     LiSp(s) & languages like Clojure & ClojureScript, however I am better adapated to Python, as I see it as a useful programming language
     to get ideas up, and running quickly. Having said that I am easily able to grasp any syntax pretty quickly. 
     Programming Languages are ever evolving, and I prefer Python to get ideas working in a shorter period of time. I find the language 
     useful for building trade strategies, and snippets of script to reinforce security of networks. I am focusing on the security & financial
     technological aspect of things, rather than web development in itself. 
     However this by no means defuncts my ability to build web apps with languages like JavaScript, React, etc.
     
- 💻 Currently, I am learning about Blockchain Technology, and trying to wrap my head around the Elliptical Curve Cryptography of
     Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Monero. I also like The-Open-Network (TON), as well as Polkadot & Algorand.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on "Pythonic" Projects to furtherly increase my reputation to recruiters in a more like, "niche'"-like 
     sense, also have some fun, challenge myself and my own abilities. I would like to get better clued up on security scripting,
     blockchain development and projects which focus on the presentation and access to information. I do feel strongly about fixing 
     the problem of how information is presented, and accessed in user experience. It's a big reason why I advocate cryptocurrency, 
     if that can make any sense to you! 😉
