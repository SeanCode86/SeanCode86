## ðŸš€ About Me

Hello I'm Sean and I work as a UPS Technician, but enjoy computer programming as a hobby. I work in a family orietated business and mainly use my abilities to code to make things for myself and to make my life and work easier. I enjoy bot development, web development, security and blockchain focused software. I am not a professional developer, just have a keen interest in computer science, math and science in general.
