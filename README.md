## 🚀 About Me

Hi there! I'm Sean. I'm not a traditionally educated programmer, rather it has been a keen hobby of mine the last
16 years or so, and I have really taught myself everything I know. I feel confident to change my career from Electrical Enginneering,
whereby I worked with UPS Systems, in a turnkey context. Professionally I have only ever worked in my family business, whereby one pioneership
of UPS technology can be found within the Republic of South Africa. Working with our own designs of UPS Systems, is where I picked up
a keen interest in computer programming and computing systems in general. I have a passion for building things, and like to see my creations 
come to life. I am quite a difficult person, I dont make friends very well, but I am a team-player for something I believe in. I have a very complicated belief system.
I believe in G.O.D, or Good. Orderly. Direction. I strive for logic and orderly fashion in systematics, according to the recursion and purpose of the application or solution. I think reinventing the wheel is idiocy. I am fiercely critical person, and can handle it right back. I was an apprentice in a UPS factory, not a pencil pushing office, so I may struggle in an office environment at first, but will quickly adapt. I can adapt very quckly to any given eniviroment.   

- 👀 I kinda got into programming, via first learning Python about 15 or so years ago. So I'll always like Python🐍. So I like fields of work which
     generally, go along the scope of 'Pythonic' code. Things like; Fintech, Cyber Security, Data Science, AI and Bot Development. However I still very much like 
     doing web development, whereby I like to use TypeScript, within an Angular Workspace. I enjoy, the "immutable" mindset, and I prefer to code in a
     functional paradigm. I do really enjoy learning about the LiSp(s) & languages like Clojure & ClojureScript, however I am better adapated to
     Python, as well working with TypeScript, within an Angular WorkSpace. Having said all this, I see Python as a useful programming language to 
     get ideas up, and running quickly. I am able to grasp any syntax of any langugae, pretty quickly. Including the LiSp(s).  
     
- 💻 Currently I am learning Angular, because I want to get a job as a software developer, and gain access to industry. Cause with one foot in, I'll shoot among the ranks extremely quickly. So basically halted by self education in cryptography and blockchain. Blockchain technology isnt ready for wide-scale adoption in my own personal opinion. Having said this, I believe in projects like Algorand and Monero. I stay away from Bitcoin. I don't like the community behind Bitcoin. Its a mess, and it needs to properpy regulated by financial authroties. Also any developer who hides their identity is a big red flag for me, personally. I enjoy learning about Google are doing with quantum computers, as Quantum Mechanics is of deep intruging interest to me. I like to play around with Beautiful Soup, but that will be rendered redundant, once AI get more innovative. I do believe in what OpenAI are doing. I like the company quite a bit, even with its obvious ethical flaws. It just needs to be innovated by programmers, who believe in moral and ethical codes of work and deployment.  
     
- 💞️ I would like to maybe callobrate on Pythonic projects, where Financial Technologies, work hand in hand with Cyber Security. I do enjoy matters to do
      with security, wether it be in a digital paradigm or not. The way crimes are performed in the modern day is something of intruiging interest to me. I 
      like to imagine ways or solutions to mitigate its effect on modern day life, and that of ordinary people, who are not techinically inclined 
      
- ⚙️ There are a variety of tools I use. For the most part I prefer to run my scripts in Python virtual enviroments, preferably I like to use conda enviroments,
      over that of the Python generic (venv). I find it easier to handle dependencies, and if I want to, I can still use the pip package manager in any case. 
      For stuff I build as web apps, I like to keep things as simple, and as multi-platform as possible, so I'll generally use a mixture of Flask framework, 
      FastAPI and Streamlit. I'm also teaching myself Angular, Node.js and general JavaScript, so I can carry on from where I stopped, from teaching myself  ClojureScript. Once I'm fully fledged and comfortable with Angular, I will continue my self education in Clojure. 
     
- 📫 How to reach me ... For now -> captainbrunton@gmail.com or mrY2k@mail.com or you may send me a short message on Telegram @GalaxyBrainGuyDude. I will 
      try assist and answer any questions or queries you may have. To engage with me on social media, is not enaging with my professional mindset. My social media profile are for my entertainment, not for my career. There is a distinct diffirence to me in real life and one I put on social media, and I don't want to work with anyone, you will bully me because of it. That's a reflection of the person and not me.
